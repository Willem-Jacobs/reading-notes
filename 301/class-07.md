- **Who is Roy Fielding?** > One of the principal authors of HTTP specifcations and the originator of REST style. Source: Wikipedia.

- **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** > The machines to do that. The machines do not have a 'noun' but having the URL is important as it will allow the systems to tell each other about each other's nouns.

- **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** > It applies verbs to the nouns (URL) and then is able to tell the machine to perform that action of the verb.

- **What does `GET` do?** > retrieves data from the URL end point.

- **What does `POST` do?** > adds something on another system URL end point.

- **What does `PUT` do?** > replace someting on another system using the URL end point.

- **What does `PATCH` do?** > partial udpate on another system using the URL end point.
