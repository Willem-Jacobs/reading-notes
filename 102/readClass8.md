# Reading Class 8: Operators & Loops

## Operators

- `==` is equal to checking value only not care of type
- `===` is strict equal to meaning checks value and type
- `!=` is not equal checking value only not care of type
- `!==` is strict equal to meaning checks value and type
- `<` Less than checks if the value on left is less than the value on the right.
- `>` Greater than.
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

- `&&` is the AND operator where both conditions (left & right of symbol) need to evaluate to TRUE.
- `||` is the OR operator where either of the values need to evaluate to TRUE.

## Loops

- There are 2 main loops used. There are more but the 3rd one, a DO WHILE is not used much.
- Loops check a condition, if it returns TRUE a code block will run. Condition checked again and continues till the condition returns false. Each time the condition is TRUE the logic in the code block runs.
- The FOR loop is used to run the logic a set number of times and is the most common loop type. The FOR loop uses a counter that is defined at the start and it maintains this counter.
- The WHILE loop is used to run till a certain condition is met. The counter or condition check has to be established outside of the loop and any changes to this counter need to be done inside the loop.
- The DO WHILE loop is similar to the loop but it checks the condition after running the logic code block at least once. It runs this even if the condition is false at the first try.
- Loops can return a value by using the RETURN statement.
