## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

**[Reading from - Link](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)**

- **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?** > The PC started to show up in the homes. They were marketed almost entirely for men and boys. This helped define who geeks were and created a techie culture. Movie industry also portrayed this symbolism.

- **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** > When the male reaches college in the 80s, it was assumed that they had a greater understanding and professors assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. This comes from day that families were more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls.

- **When are diversity efforts most successful?** > Driven by a commitment from company leaders. 5 themes are: Diverse teams are smarter and more creative. Diverse companies perform better. Companies are losing out on great talent. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base. It is the right thing to do.

- **Why do diverse companies perform better?** > Seems people value and use companies that have diversity more than those that donâ€™t. This in my own words but the data shows the same.

- **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.** > A diverse company will build products and tech that serve the entire group better. They are effectively made better for those groups. When not diverse, the group builds just for its own taste. Example the YouTube for right handed people as the group was just about entirely right handed.
