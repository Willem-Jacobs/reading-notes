## NoSQL or SQL

**[Reading from - Link](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)**

- **Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:** >

  - SQL-Relational Database, Table Based, Predefined Schema, Vertically Scalable, uses SQL for defining and manipulating the data.
  - NoSQL-Distributed Database, Document Based or key-value pairs or graph databases or wide-column stores, Dynamic Schema for Unstructured Data, Horizontal Scalable, Queries focused on collection of documents.

- **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** > High transaction databasesas it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.

- **Give a real world example.** > Airline reservations systems

- **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?** > Large data sets.

- **Give a real world example.** > Blog system

- **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?** > SQL

- **Which type of database is best for scalability?** > NoSQL

## SQL Vs NoSQL

**[Video from - Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y)**

- **What does SQL stand for?** > Structured Query Language

- **What is a realational database?** > Database with works in a certain way and supports SQL that works with tables, columns and rows. Tables can also be linked with a one-to-one or one-to-manu or many-to-many relations between the tables.

- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?** > Defined by a schema that have fields pre-defined. That use tables, columns and rows.

- **What is a ‘schema’?** > The structure of the table definition

- **What is a NoSQL database?** > A database that does not use SQL and stores data in collections, document, value sets with no schema applied.

- **How does it work?** > Stores data in a different method but needs all kept together in the colleciton.

- **What is inside of a Mongo database?** > Very flexible database that holds collections, documents with no schema can modify the structure and what is saved at anytime and no true relations.

- **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?** > Hard to say as I like SQL as I am used to it but i can see some benefits of MondoDB. MondoDB is more flexible as you have no schema, can modify the structure and what is stored at anytime.

- **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** > No master tables to use so if you change a key value, you need to change it everywhere where it i stored. All the data for a colleciton needs to be kept together. Each colleciton holds all the data it needs as NoSQL has no relations.
