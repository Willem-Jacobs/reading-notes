# Git Notes Read:03

Git is used on your local machine to create version control & backup archive. It is a CLI (Command Line Interface) utility.

There are a few key steps to follow to create a master/main branch of your work into a repository. This defined as **ACP:**
- Add by using: git add `filename.extension` or `.` or `--all`
- Commit to local repository: git commit -m `"comment for your records"`
- Push to GitHub active repository: git push origin main (main defiles the branch)
- Check current status: `git status` will show you the current status of your local repository.

If you are using GitHub would be best to create the repository on GitHub first then clone it to your local machine so all the needed values are set. This done by copying the repository address from GitHub then using the clone command on your machine. Ensure you are in the directory on your local machine where you want the new directory/repository cloned. The command to clone is:
- git clone `https://..........` past your repository address here.

**KEY REMINDER** once you clone a repository DO NOT MAKE any further changes to it on GitHub. Do all from your machine locally and push the changes up to the GitHub repository.
