# Reading Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

## Reading 06a

- Starter code was written for us so did not have to type it all in.
- Did the steps that needed to be checked to see the outcome.
- The placement of the JS script file tag in the HTML is important.
- Use the `<script>` tag to import the file. `src` is used to specify the file name.
- JS can be mixed in the HTML but this is not best practice as seperation is needed for the HTML, CSS and JS code files.
- Objects of JS have methods that can be called and passed values.
- Calling a method of an object you use the object name then a "." then the methond name with "()" after and passing the values, arguments, functions, etc, called parameters, into the methond between the "()".
- JS uses statements that computer follows one-by-one and send with a ";".
- JS is case sensetive.
- Statements can be organized into code blocks.
- Variables are used to hold data in an understanding name and are used by the code to run and perform its task.
- JS is scoped based for variables.
- Variable names do not change but the value they hold can.
- declare a variable using the `var` command then a space and provide a meaningful name for the variable. ALL variables have names. Newer versions of JS you can use `const` to create a constant where the variable value does not change for a text and number based variable. These are Primitive Variables. Reference Variables are objects & arrays that hold a reference to the location of the value in memory. The key word `let` can be used to declare a varibale that can change. These 2 key words are used more now and not the `var`.
- Use camelCase syntax in JS.
- Assign values to the variable by using the '=' then the value to be assigned. This can be text, number, boolean, object or array. A variable with no value is considered `undefined`.
