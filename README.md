## My Bio & History
I am **Willem (Will) Jacobs**. I am attending the *CodeFellows* classes to improve my skill set to become a freelance web/web app developer based in The Cayman Islands. I have always had a passion for coding but my carreer path took me out of it. I am now wanting to return to my passion. I am 51 years old and currently the Deputy Director of Operations for The Port Authority of The Cayman Islands. I have worked for the Port Authority for 25 years spending 10 of those years in the IT department as a coder/network tech/system administrator/support/project manager then to IT Department Manager before moving to upper management. While at the Port Authority, I have developed various software packages for desktop windows systems and mobile terminals using .NET Compact Framework. These applications are still in use today.
