# Reading Class 6b

The parts I enjoyed the most are:
- Binary & Data
- Circuits and Logic
- Hardware and Software

All 3 of these are areas that I work with during the code process. All 3 of these show the speed, ability & power of computers along with the details that go into making them work and do the tasks we all use daily.
