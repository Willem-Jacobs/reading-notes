# Reading: Class 7 - Programming with JavaScript

## Intro & Scripts
- Script language is a set of instructions that the computer executes in order to complete a process.
- Scripts need to detail all the steps in order that are required.
- Determing your goal, flow out the process using flowcharts. Create detailed steps for each action/process. Write code based on these smaller chunks.

## Expressions & Operators
- Expressions
  - There are 2 types. A single expression where you use the `=` to assign a single value to a variable. The second is when you use 2 or more values to return a single value.
- Operators
  - This is the `=`' to assing value to a varibale.
  - There are arithmetic operators that are commong like `+ - / * ++ -- %`. Using arithmetic in computers use the same order and principal like standard math & algebra.
  - For strings the only operator you can really use is the `+` to concatenate strings together.

## Functions

- Functions allow you to name chuncks of code and call them to be executed when needed to perform a certain task. Data can be passed into the function by specifying arguments when calling (invoking) the function. The function is defined with parameters that match the arguments being passed in. A function can return data after it is executed. This data is stored in a variable that is defiled when invoking the function.
