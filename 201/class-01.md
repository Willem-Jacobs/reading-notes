        to reach outcome for the task.

    - Code each step.
    - Computers creates models of the world.
        - uses Objects to define the data set (items).
        - Objects (the item) can have properties (physical data) and methods (tasks).
        - Events are the interaction with the object that changes its properties by executing methods.
    - Web browsers create an Object of the page having the item, properties, methods and monitors events that happen to that object.
    - The main HTML web page becomes the object containing properties (data), methods (the code that changes the data) and events (trigger for the changes) that use the methods to change the properties.
    - HTM is the content layer. CSS is the presentation layer and JavaScript is the behavior layer.
    - Calling a method on an object uses dot notation. Refer to the object instance name then a "." then the method with its defined parameter passed in.
    `object.write("hello world!")` object here is the instance (name) of the object then the "." and WRITE is the methond of that object being called.
    - A JavaScript (JS) script file is ran from the HMTL using the `<script>` tag in your html file. Placement of this line is critical as it will run where the file is found and this can lead to the wrong results.
    - Script file does not change your HTML file. It changes the HTML object model that the browser creates.
